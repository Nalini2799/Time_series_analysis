### Time_series_analysis
 - Time_series_analysis is basically, trying to visualise the different aspects of time series data by checking of white   noise,random walk and stationality in the data. </br>
 - A random walk is one in which future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history. </br>
 - QQ plot - The Q-Q plot can be used to quickly check the normality of the distribution of residual errors. </br>
 - This repo will demostrate the concept of stationality,Randomwalk,QQ-plot and White noise.
